# Arkanoid-Multi

## Add ROM files here

Add the following ROM zip files to this dir:

- arkanoid.zip
- arkatayt.zip
- arkatour.zip

## Add Patch files here

Create the following files using 'xdelta patcher' on arkatayt and arkatour ROMs, and copy them to this dir. Instructions can be found in the [KLOV thread](https://forums.arcade-museum.com/threads/arkanoid-freeplay-rom.508179/). Patch files for xdelta (by @mdeslaur) can be found in the 'patch' directory. These add freeplay, bypass the MCU and address a few bugs.
